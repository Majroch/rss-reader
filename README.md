Simple RSS Reader
================

This is my small RSS reader written in Python 3.

**I don't like GUI apps btw :)**

This program was written for Linux, not meant to be launched on Windows.

### 1. Pre-requirements
First of all, install required packages:
```bash
sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Usage
You'll need a `rss.txt` file that contains all links to your favourite RSS sites:
```
https://example.com/rss.xml
https://another.example.com/rss
```

After that, just run `main.py` file:
```bash
./main.py
```
